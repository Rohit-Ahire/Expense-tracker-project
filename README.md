# Expense Tracker

This project is a simple Expense Tracker web application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add income and expense entries, view the balance updates in real time, and manage their transactions. The application uses the browser's LocalStorage to save all data so that transactions remain available even after the page is refreshed.
